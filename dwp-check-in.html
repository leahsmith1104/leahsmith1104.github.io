                <p class="story-about__body">The project team consisted of a Product Owners, Delivery Managers, Business Analysts, User Researchers, Subject Matter Experts, Developers, Technical Architects, Content Design and myself representing User Experience/Interaction Design. It also included Stakeholders from other departments such as Policy, Service Design Transformation, Legal, fraud etc.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">This team in the past had already looked at bringing customer computers into jobcentres across the UK to try and fulfill their vision that every citizen has access to outstanding support to help them back into work. The final solution, decided upon after a discovery phase, was a self service check in for customers that needed to be fully accessible to all, including those with accessibility, and assisted digital needs. This was a continuation of the previous project to carry forwards the long term vision.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">There were three parts to the self check in service which are as follows; The claimant facing check in, the admin system for front of house staff to upload the appointments to on a daily basis and customise instructions for their jobcentre, and finally a notification to alert the work coach that the claimant had arrived.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">After initial research into the best solution, and taking into consideration environmental familiarisation, from GP surgeries and self checkouts in supermarkets, it was decided touch screens would be the best place to start. Although the government design system is fully responsive, it is very much designed for transactional websites therefore I needed to adapt the design and think outside of the box to make our service intuitive, quick and easy to use. This would be the first time the department has utilised touch devices in this way.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">To make sure we stuck to a user centered design approach we used assumption and hypothesis workshops/boards to work out what our problem statements were and what the biggest/riskiest problems were that need tackling. These were all tracked using Jira where we could move them through the columns from backlog through to validated, prototyped and tested.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">The prototyping for this project started as a collaborative team effort on paper to make sure the correct user flow was created. After which I then developed them further by producing functioning prototypes in either sketch (to visualise our userflows) and HTML/CSS, using the government prototyping toolkit.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">This was quite an exciting project to work on as it was something completely different to what the government, and the prototyping toolkit/guidelines usually stipulate. This was the first time the government had produced a solely touch non web based application.  It was great to push boundaries and create new patterns which involved heavy research around accessibility and usability (touch target sizes etc) and a lot of weekly prototyping and user testing sessions to get the design right.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">We used a iterative design - test- feedback loop on this process that ran on a weekly basis. I took part in research sessons, aiding the researcher where necessary and observing claimants on site in jobcentres using the prototypes that I had created to help me evaluate and iterate upon week by week. As well as working with Jobcentre staff, getting their opinion on and testing new admin/notification systems and ideas to improve and make their jobs easier on many of the benefit systems.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">Most of the testing was iterative, to check usability of prototypes and ideas that had been formulated from user needs. But a lot of it also helped validate assumptions and also identify new user needs.</p>
