                <p class="story-about__body">This service is already part digital, the application process was completed in 2016. However research conducted in the early part of this process, by both user research and research from business analysis into statistics, raised consistency issues in the online application, that would need to be addressed and improved, before we could proceed to turning the current clerical acceptance process into a new digital transformation.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The second part of this project looked at the digital service transformation of the current clerical acceptance process. This was deemed necessary to speed up the process of the budget loan application as a whole. Research and discovery journey maps showed the average wait time, for what is deemed a loan for emergencies was taking 12 weeks. This was due to a breakdown in the claimant understanding the offer letter/how to accept and postal/processing delays, therefore turning it into a digital acceptance could not only save money but turn weeks of waiting into only days.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">The solution created needed to be fully accessible to all customers, including those with accessibility, assisted digital and appointee needs. Many of the government systems are legacy and have complex interactions from a technological point of view. Workarounds need to be found for these systems when integrating new ideas. The old saying too many cooks (or in this case too much experience) spoils the broth simply isn't true and the more people in the workshops the better.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">My role Included the facilitation of workshops (including assumption/hypothesis, persona, user journey mapping and user flow) with the whole team, and sometimes wider stakeholders. Workshops are a favourite of mine as I find making things interactive gets the whole team discussing and sharing ideas, in turn everyone gains an in depth understanding from all our areas of expertise which aids the production of the best solution. My role also included producing the finished artifact from the workshop, whether it be a persona, user journey/flow diagram or a presentation to senior stakeholders.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body flush__bottom"><strong>User flows</strong></p>
                <p class="story-about__body">I mainly created user flows in this project as a visual tool. Created in sketch I paired them with prototypes built using the government design system toolkit (more explained about this below), to show where a live project needed to undergo improvement, and how we could improve it. Not only did this help form and understanding with senior stakeholders but it was also very useful for the developers and testers to see where the new interactions slotted into the current process, and any effects that may have on their development.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">User flows also aided the visualisation of the new acceptance service to the team and wider stakeholders from and end to end process point of view, especially when paired with technical architect drawings. It is sometimes difficult to follow on a prototype/technical diagram when a journey can go in many directions, so the user flows definitely helped sell the full story on this project.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body flush__bottom"><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>
                <p class="story-about__body">For this project I put a prototype index together as a main source of truth so that stakeholders, and anyone outside the team, could quickly catch up on what we have been doing and as a way of showing our iterative process. It included the following: </p> 
                <ul class="story-about__body">
                    <li class="story-about__list">Old application process prototype, before we made any suggested improvements (so we could show how effective our improvements were against the old).</li>
                    <li class="story-about__list">Latest application process prototype (which we deemed the master prototype) which had all the tested and verified improvements, that were ready for development, integrated.</li>
                    <li class="story-about__list">A page dedicated to all the snippet prototypes (mainly idea generation) that weren't taken forward but were used to improve the application process.</li>
                    <li class="story-about__list">A page dedicated to user research and which prototypes had been tested and the location.</li>
                    <li class="story-about__list">End to end user flow of the proposed service transformation</li>
                    <li class="story-about__list">A page dedicated to other user flows that had been created to back up prototypes</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="story-about__body">The prototypes for the projects were built HTML/CSS/Javascript, using the government design system prototyping toolkit. Each prototype adhered to the strict government design system guidelines (which is assessed at the end of alpha, beta etc). In instances where we had justified reason, and user research evidence, we deviated away and created new patterns. I shared and contributed these patterns, and the reasoning behind our improvements, to the wider cross government design community as knowledge share and improvement to current standards. This project paved the way on improving address look up functionality, preferred contact methods and appointee/assisted digital applications from a claimants perspective across the DWP.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">I helped our researcher when she was struggling with volume. On this project it included telephone interviews to gauge the full extent of the user needs and problems of the current service (where a claimant applies digitally and then has to wait to be processed manually and accepts using a wet signature via postal methods before receiving their loan) and how that time expectation can be managed and improved. In turn, experiencing this first hand improved my knowledge of the pain points claimants encountered,  producing a better end result for the customer.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The testing on the prototypes was iterative and checked usability. It was carried out by user research, with me observing from time to time. I often helped collate the results and presented back to the wider team/stakeholders. A lot of the testing also helped validate our assumptions and identify new user needs.</p>
