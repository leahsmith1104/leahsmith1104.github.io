                <p class="story-about__body">As part of a business need to live the proposition of “Experts in the Unexpected”, the Prize machine concept was created. From research, we knew that players love the buzz of the unpredictable, that thrill of ‘what if’ and the frisson they feel at the push of a button. Prize machine is to encompasses this.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">A team was created to tackle this brief which included myself representing UI and Interaction, UX, Marketing, Brand, Creative, Product, Compliance and Media.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="story-about  project-about" data-aos="fade-in"  data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-delay="200">
                <p class="story-about__body">Key meetings took place with stakeholders and the representatives of the brief team. In which it was decided That a stripe on the homepage, below the hero offer, would be the best way to market Prize Machine. It needed to be possible to change the state to let users know how long it would be until their spin was ready, or when their spin was ready. And if they weren’t opted in then an emotive marketing piece to engage them.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">My role was to focus on the UI and interaction. The main requirement for me was to highlight Prize machine on the homepage, this included the various states of pre-opt in, ‘countdown’ and ‘spin ready’. And then the animation and the interaction of the machine itself.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">Placement wireframes were created for the hero and a countdown stripe. Looking at the best place that it could sit on the homepage. After testing internally, it was decided that the best place to locate it was under the hero. Mainly so it can tie in with other campaigns and the user isn't asked to scroll too far.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">At the same time as the wireframe process I looked at a proof of concept around the animation of the actual prize machine. It was proved that some reels could be started at the push of a button and then land on certain sequences to reveal a win or a loss animation in CSS.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">The final Prize Machine logo was provided by brand and which meant wireframes could be visualised and fed back on, also the proof of concept could be updated and the machine itself could be built. The animation of the machine needed to be similar to the ones used in TV, therefore some additional loss animations were produced so that it didn’t become stagnant or look staged.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">Below are the designs that were pulled together for Prize Machine. These came from having the layout pretty much locked down by initial wireframe testing, but with a need to apply the prize machine campaign branding across the hero. As a one off the hero was replaced when the spin was ready. But a decision by stakeholders was made to keep the full journey in the stripe</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">As part of a wider project ongoing in Vegas, we tested the Prize Machine prototypes with Vegas customers using various methods, such as remote and user lab testing.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The aim of these methods was to gather as much insight as possible into how Vegas customers perceived Prize Machine as a concept and find if it would be something they would have an invested interest in. This testing showed customers had a positive response to the campaign concept and overall experience as a whole, whilst stating that the random chance of winning brought a huge sense of excitement and anticipation.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">This also followed on from another outcome that our customers loves playing Slot games due to their unpredictability and sense that anything can happen, with Prize Machine carrying on this trend but offering chances of winning more lucrative prizes off the back of a free spin.</p>
