                <p class="story-about__body">As part of a business need to live the proposition of “Experts in the Unexpected”, the Prize machine concept was created from research, we knew that players love the buzz of the unpredictable, that thrill of ‘what if’ and the frisson they feel at the push of a button. Prize machine encompasses this.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">A team was created to tackle this brief which included myself representing UI and Interaction, UX, Marketing, Brand, Creative, Product, Compliance and Media.</p>

            <div class="story-about  project-about" data-aos="fade-in"  data-aos-duration="1000" data-aos-delay="200">
                <p class="story-about__body">Key meetings took place with stakeholders and the representatives of the brief team. In which it was decided That a small stripe on the homepage would be the best way to market Prize Machine. It would be possible to change the state to let users know how long it would be until their spin was ready, or when their spin was ready. And if they weren’t opted in then an emotive marketing piece to engage them.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">My role was to focus on the UI and interaction. The main requirement for me was to highlight Prize machine on the homepage, this included the various states of pre-opt in, ‘countdown’ and ‘spin ready’. And then the animation and the interaction of the machine itself.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">Placement wireframes were created for the stripe, looking at the best place that it could sit on the homepage. After testing internally, it was decided that the best place to locate it was under the hero. Mainly so it can tie in with other campaigns and so it isn’t hidden, it’s placed under the nose of customers. There is no chance they will miss it because they’re asked to scroll too far.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">At the same time as the wireframe process I looked at a proof of concept around the animation of the actual prize machine. It was proved that some reels could be started at the push of a button and then land on certain sequences to reveal a win or a loss animation in CSS.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">The final bonus time logo was provided by brand and aimed to carry through the importance of time with the use of cogs. After seeing the logo I used my initiative and added animation to capture the eye of any customer visiting Vegas and maybe tempt them into the bonus time detail page, or remind them about Bonus Time. This animation was similar to the ones used in external media, such as TV and Social Media.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">As part of a wider project ongoing in Vegas, we tested the Bonus Time prototypes with Vegas customers using various methods, such as remote and user lab testing.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The aim of these methods was to gather as much insight as possible into how Vegas customers perceived Bonus Time as a concept and find if it would be something they would have an invested interest in. This testing showed customers had a positive response to the campaign concept and overall experience as a whole, whilst stating that the random chance of winning brought a huge sense of excitement and anticipation.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">This also followed on from another outcome that our customers loves playing Slot games due to their unpredictability and sense that anything can happen, with Bonus Time carrying on this trend but offering chances of winning more lucrative prizes.</p>
