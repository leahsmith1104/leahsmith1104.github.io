                <p class="story-about__body">As many of these projects were end to end service designs, Journey Mapping workshops and meetings were essential to make sure every point in the journey was considered and problems that may be encountered identified. Many of the government systems are legacy and therefore there are complications interacting and finding work arounds for these systems, therefore the old saying too many cooks (or in this case too much experience) spoils the broth simply isn't true and the more people in the workshops the better.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">User flows were used mainly for iterative design purposes in the alpha stage of the projects, or on a live project that needed to undergo improvement.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">To make sure we stuck to a user centered design approach we used assumption and hypothesis workshops/boards to work out what our problem statements were and what the biggest/riskiest problems were that need tackling. These were all tracked using Trello where we could move them through the columns from backlog through to validated, prototyped and tested.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body flush__bottom"><strong>Prototyping</strong></p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The prototypes for the projects usually started as a collaborative team effort on paper to make sure the correct user flow was created. After which I then developed them further by producing functioning prototypes in either sketch or HTML/CSS, using the government prototyping toolkit, depending on level of design/interaction required. Each prototype adhered to the strict government design system guidelines (which is assessed at the end of every stage) apart from the self check in service for Jocentres.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">The self check in for Jobcentres was quite an exciting project to work on as this was something completely different to what the government, and the prototyping toolkit/guidelines usually stipulate. This was the first time the government had produced a solely touch non web based application. It involved heavy research around accessibility and usability (touch target sizes etc) and a lot of weekly prototyping and user testing.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body flush__bottom"><strong>User testing and research</strong></p>
                <p class="story-about__body">I helped carry out user testing and research across all of the projects. This included telephone interviews to gauge the full extent of the user needs and problems of an end to end service such as Budget loans where an applicant has to apply and then wait to be approved before receiving a loan, and how that time expectation can be managed and improved. Testing and observing Claimants on site in jobcentres using the prototypes that I had created and continue to iterate upon. As well as working with Jobcentre staff testing new admin systems and ideas to improve and make their jobs easier on many of the benefit systems. Right through to working with employers to iterate and improve the current live services they use (Find a Job), in turn producing a better end result for the customer.</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">Most of the testing was iterative, and to check usability of prototypes and ideas that had been formulated from user needs. But a lot of it also helped validate assumptions and also identify new user needs. It was also in Discovery and Alpha phases, so little A/B testing took place.</p>
