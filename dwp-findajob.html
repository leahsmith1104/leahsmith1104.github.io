I also helped review the disability confidence flow for employers and work on a prototype to make this service better.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">Part of my role Included facilitating workshops, along side Content Design, with the whole team, to get them discussing and gaining an in depth understanding of all our customers and their needs. Not only this but also documenting the common journeys and pain points encountered along the way. I found this particularly useful, as my knowledge of the service was limited. This was definitely the fastest way to get up to speed and get hands on with people who interact with the service on a daily basis.</p>

                    <p class="story-about__body">To make sure we stuck to a user centered design approach, I paired with the Content designer after running the workshops and we prepared an assumption/hypothesis board based on user needs/pain points. Not only was this to document the outcomes of the workshops but also to work out what our problem statements were around the service and what the biggest/riskiest problems that the team needed to tackle first going forwards. These were all tracked using Jira where we could move them through the columns from backlog through to validated, prototyped and tested if necessary. It was also a useful tool and discussion point when feeding back to the wider business.</p>

                <p class="story-about__body">I built a prototype for the disability confidence admin side of this project. It was built using the HTML/CSS/Javascript, based on the government prototyping toolkit, and interacted with the government Notify service to send emails/text messages. It was utilised in user testing with employers, to test if the journey was correct, and that we hadn't created more work for the employer, or caused any new unecessary problems when compared to the non digital way they currently operate (using a spreadsheet).</p>
                <p class="story-about__body">We prototyped and tested in an iterative manor based on the user needs/journey improvements that were highlighted in each user testing session. Before we were happy with the prototype to hand over to the third party to build and maintain.</p>
